Task:
Create a web application for managing a list of books.

Requirements:
1. Authentication:
Implement a login page where users can enter their email and password to log in.
Users should be able to register for a new account with a unique email and password.
After login, users should be redirected to the main dashboard page.

2. Main Dashboard Page:
Display a paginated list of books with sorting capabilities.
Each book should have properties like title, author, publication year, and genre.
Initially, the list can be populated with some dummy data.
Dashboard should not be accessible if the user is not logged in.

3. CRUD Operations:
Add functionality to create, read, update, and delete books.
List of books should contain sorting, pagination and filters.
Implement a form to add new books to the list, including input validation using Formik.
Allow users to view the book details.
Allow users to edit the book details through an edit form.
Add a delete button to remove books from the list. Before deleting, ask for the user's confirmation.


Technical Requirements:
Use ReactJS for building the frontend components.
Utilize Context for state management.
Use Formik for handling form input and validation.
Employ TypeScript for static type checking.
Implement pagination and sorting for the book list.
Commit each functionality separately with clear commit messages.
Push the code to a public GitHub repository and share the repository link with the team.

Submission Guidelines:
Create a new public repository on GitHub for your project.
Implement each functionality as a separate commit. The commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
Include a README file in the repository with instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
Make sure to include any necessary dependencies in the project so that it can be easily run on another machine.
Share the link to the public repository with us once you're done.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Successful implementation of user authentication using email and password.
CRUD operations for managing the list of books.
Proper usage of ReactJS, Context, Formik, and TypeScript.
Proper implementation of pagination and sorting functionalities.
Well-documented code with clear commit messages.
